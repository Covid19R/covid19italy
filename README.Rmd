The covid19italy R package provides a tidy format dataset of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic outbreak in Italy. The package includes the following three datasets:

- `italy_total` - daily summary of the outbreak on the national level
- `italy_region` - daily summary of the outbreak on the region level
- `italy_province` - daily summary of the outbreak on the province level 



Data source: [Italy Department of Civil Protection](http://www.protezionecivile.it/)


## Installation

You can install the released version of covid19italy from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/covid19italy/index.html) with:

``` r
install.packages("covid19italy")
```

Or, install the most recent version from [GitHub](https://github.com/covid19italy/covid19italy) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Covid19R/covid19Italy")
```

## Data refresh

The **covid19italy** package dev version is been updated on a daily bases. The `update_data` function enables a simple refresh of the installed package datasets with the most updated version on Github:

``` r
library(covid19italy)

update_data()
```

Note: must restart the R session to have the updates available


## Usage


```{r}
data(italy_total)

head(italy_total)
```


### Plotting the active cases distribution


``` r
library(plotly)

plot_ly(data = italy_total,
        x = ~ date,
        y = ~home_confinement, 
        name = 'Home Confinement', 
        fillcolor = '#FDBBBC',
        type = 'scatter',
        mode = 'none', 
        stackgroup = 'one') %>%
  add_trace( y = ~ hospitalized_with_symptoms, 
             name = "Hospitalized with Symptoms",
             fillcolor = '#E41317') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~intensive_care, 
                name = 'Intensive Care', 
                fillcolor = '#9E0003') %>%
  layout(title = "Italy - Distribution of Active Covid19 Cases",
         legend = list(x = 0.1, y = 0.9),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of Cases"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Source: Italy Department of Civil Protection"))

### Plotting the daily cases distribution 
```r
plot_ly(data = italy_total,
        x = ~ date,
        y = ~total_currently_positive, 
        name = 'Active', 
        fillcolor = '#1f77b4',
        type = 'scatter',
        mode = 'none', 
        stackgroup = 'one') %>%
  add_trace( y = ~ death, 
             name = "Death",
             fillcolor = '#E41317') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~recovered, 
            name = 'Recovered', 
            fillcolor = 'forestgreen') %>%
  layout(title = "Italy - Distribution of Covid19 Cases",
         legend = list(x = 0.1, y = 0.9),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of Cases"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Source: Italy Department of Civil Protection"))

### Cases distribution by region

``` r
italy_region %>% 
  filter(date == max(date)) %>% 
  select(region_name, total_currently_positive, recovered, death, total_positive_cases) %>%
  arrange(-total_positive_cases) %>%
  mutate(region = factor(region_name, levels = region_name)) %>%
  plot_ly(y = ~ region, 
          x = ~ total_currently_positive, 
          orientation = 'h',
          text =  ~ total_currently_positive,
          textposition = 'auto',
          type = "bar", 
          name = "Active",
          marker = list(color = "#1f77b4")) %>%
  add_trace(x = ~ recovered,
            text =  ~ recovered,
            textposition = 'auto',
            name = "Recovered",
            marker = list(color = "forestgreen")) %>%
  add_trace(x = ~ death, 
            text =  ~ death,
            textposition = 'auto',
            name = "Death",
            marker = list(color = "red")) %>%
  layout(title = "Cases Distribution by Region",
         barmode = 'stack',
         yaxis = list(title = "Region"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Number of Cases"),
         hovermode = "compare",
         legend = list(x = 0.65, y = 0.9),
         margin =  list(
           l = 20,
           r = 10,
           b = 10,
           t = 30,
           pad = 2
         )) 

```

### Cases distribution by province for Lombardia region

```r
italy_province %>% 
  filter(date == max(date), region_name == "Lombardia") %>%
  plot_ly(labels = ~province_name, values = ~total_cases, 
                  textinfo="label+percent",
                  type = 'pie') %>%
  layout(title = "Lombardia - Cases Distribution by Province") %>% 
  hide_legend()
```
