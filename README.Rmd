The covid19italy R package provides a tidy format dataset of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic outbreak in Italy. The package includes the following three datasets:

- `italy_total` - daily summary of the outbreak on the national level
- `italy_region` - daily summary of the outbreak on the region level
- `italy_province` - daily summary of the outbreak on the province level



## Installation

You can install the released version of covid19italy from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("covid19italy")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RamiKrispin/covid19Italy")
```
## Usage


```{r}
library(covid19italy)

data(italy_total)

head(italy_total)
```


### Plotting the active cases distribution


``` r
library(plotly)

plot_ly(data = italy_total,
        x = ~ date,
        y = ~home_confinement, 
        name = 'Home Confinement', 
        fillcolor = '#FDBBBC',
        type = 'scatter',
        mode = 'none', 
        stackgroup = 'one') %>%
  add_trace( y = ~ hospitalized_with_symptoms, 
             name = "Hospitalized with Symptoms",
             fillcolor = '#E41317') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~intensive_care, 
                name = 'Intensive Care', 
                fillcolor = '#9E0003') %>%
  layout(title = "Italy - Distribution of Active Covid19 Cases",
         legend = list(x = 0.1, y = 0.9),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of Cases"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Source: Italy Department of Civil Protection"))

### Plotting the daily cases distribution 
```r
plot_ly(data = italy_total,
        x = ~ date,
        y = ~total_currently_positive, 
        name = 'Active', 
        fillcolor = '#1f77b4',
        type = 'scatter',
        mode = 'none', 
        stackgroup = 'one') %>%
  add_trace( y = ~ death, 
             name = "Death",
             fillcolor = '#E41317') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~recovered, 
            name = 'Recovered', 
            fillcolor = 'forestgreen') %>%
  layout(title = "Italy - Distribution of Covid19 Cases",
         legend = list(x = 0.1, y = 0.9),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of Cases"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Source: Italy Department of Civil Protection"))
